      <h2 class="content-subhead">My Skills and Atrributes</h2>
      <p>In order to gain insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are, both in a personal and professional capacity, I decided to take the Meyers-Briggs personality test. This test indicated that my personality type was ISTP, and the profile characteristics line up quite succinctly with what I have experienced. </p>
      <p>One of the personality traits indicated by this test that resonated with me was the need to be in a dynamic environment. I often find myself wanting to be involved in multiple projects with varying scope and expected outcomes. The excitement from learning something new and having to adapt when challenges arise is what helps to keep me engaged and interested in the task at hand. This can be a beneficial trait to have in a workplace as it allows me to jump into tasks quickly and find creative solutions that deliver results. However, during my working life I have found this can also be a roadblock when I am stuck with the same task day in and day out, I tend to get bored, lose interest and procrastinate. This is something that I am aware of and have been actively working towards improving. When I find myself losing interest in a task, I find that taking a brief break by walking away from it can help me to come back to the task refreshed and allow me to finish the task in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>Another characteristic indicated in the test which aligns quite well with me is my need for my manager or mentor to give me space and freedom to figure out solutions to the problems they want me to solve. I enjoy having projects to complete. If I have a manager or mentor who trusts that I can finish a task on time this often leads to a mutually beneficial working environment. If given this, I am quite content in my loyalty towards the workplace.</p>
      <p>My logical and methodological way of thinking means I am an excellent communicator and clear in the message I am delivering. My to the point communication results in nothing getting lost in translation, but at times this can come across as blunt even though I don’t intend it to. A way that has helped me navigate this in a work environment is taking the time to understand my colleague’s communication styles and how they like to receive information. This allows me to tailor my delivery (and soften where needed) while still maintaining clear and concise communication.</p>
      <p>The mix of my creative yet practical thinking helps me to come up with solutions that have not yet been tried or tested. I work well in dynamic environments and can adapt to change when it occurs. I am highly driven, and results focused. With all this said, there are some aspects which I know can be improved. Given the time to work on turning my weaknesses to strengths, I know I can provide immense value to the workplace.</p>

      <h2 class="content-subhead">What I am looking for</h2>
      <p>I would like to be in a workplace where I can be mentored by someone who has an extensive skill set and is able to provide me with valuable insight I would not normally be exposed to. If there were multiple mentors with differing ideas and opinions this would be ideal. I find that I learn the most when there is an opportunity to pick the brain of someone who holds a different viewpoint than my own.</p>
      <p>Something I strive for in a workplace is efficiency and improving upon processes to make work run smoothly for not only myself, but those around me. I would like to be given the opportunity to work on projects that contribute to making processes better. This could range from helping write the code for tech related systems or helping to create easy to use, standardised templates for advice documents.</p>
      <p>Above all else, I value a work life balance that allows me to spend time on my other interests outside of work. Because of this, I think I would be best suited in a smaller organisation rather than a big corporation. Working in a smaller organisation will also present opportunities to be a part of the team but enable me to have my own area of expertise.</p>
      <p>Although I enjoy advice and consulting related tasks, my ideal workplace would need to offer a variety of jobs that I am able to help contribute to. I want my work experience to be varied and robust, allowing me to pick up skills outside of my own as this will help to future proof my career.</p>
      <p>In the next 5 years I see myself working where I am currently at a full time capacity. I hope to have helped improve processes with our systems running smoothly without the need for manual entry.</p>
