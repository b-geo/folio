    <div class="content">

      <p class="exped"><strong>Mike Tuchscherer</strong>, Reactive Training Systems</p>
      <p>Mike has created a methodical approach to improving powerlifting programming on an individual level. It’s controlled observations and leaning on those observations to make decisions in the future.</p>
      <p>His approach can almost be generalised to the scientific method, but it has been specialised for powerlifting. His approach of being eager to find out where he is wrong and continually reassessing his beliefs is something very impressive.</p>
      <p>His Reactive Training Systems approach is something that can be used for everything outside of the gym too and that’s why it is so influential to me.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>Michael Lynch</strong>, Software Developer</p>
      <p>Michael Lynch is a software developer who has worked at Microsoft and Google but has since been working independently on his own programs and sharing his thoughts through his blog.</p>
      <p>His project TinyPilot is rather successful in its own right but what I enjoy most is his blog posts going through the ups and downs of this process and others. It gives great insights into the pitfalls of being the only developer on a project and the solutions he has. He also has a book reports section in which I’ve found some great books from.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>Nassim Taleb</strong>, Author</p>
      <p>I have read a number of Nassim Taleb’s books and articles, all of which offered me new insights. His book The Black Swan when released has a major impact for many people – in which is discussed the problem with induction – drawing generalisations from specific examples. He applies this to a number of area but the main take away is that more and more confirming evidence shouldn’t make you more certain of something, you should be looking for the evidence to disprove something.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>The Art of Thinking Clearly</strong>, by Rolf Dobelli</p>
      <p>This book allowed me to discover Nassim Taleb and Daniel Kahneman. Before this book I wasn’t aware of cognitive biases as a thing, and this book talks about 100 of them. Rolf cites Daniel Kahneman’s work in psychology on cognitive biases as well as Nassim Taleb’s The Black Swan book.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>John Danaher</strong>, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts Coach</p>
      <p>John Danaher is probably the most accomplished grappling coach, and initially it was his technique related videos that I appreciated, although that has expanded greatly.</p>
      <p>He originally started with a Doctorate in philosophy before his passion of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu became his full-time job. He is able to blend philosophy into not only grappling but more generally the learning of new skills. John will systemically break down different areas of grappling, make those easier to learn, all while being aware all systems must work in with each other. He has been able to transform people to world class performers in short periods of time, usually not thought of as possible.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>Managing Oneself</strong>, by Peter Drucker</p>
      <p>The only interaction with Peter Drucker’s work for me is through his book Managing Oneself. It’s a short book but lays out people and their different tendencies and how that would make them suited for different careers. Ultimately the message is it’s your responsibility to work these out and find a career most fulfilling for you.</p>

      <p class="exped"><strong>Sam Harris</strong>, Philosopher</p>
      <p>Sam Harris is an author as well as the host of a podcast called The Making Sense Podcast. His background is neuroscience but he has had a range of guests on his podcast touching on all topics. He discusses on the podcast and in his books the idea of mindfulness and free will – two topics that have shaped me.</p>
